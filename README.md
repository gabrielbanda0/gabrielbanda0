## Hi there, my name is Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical & Computer Engineering. I have had the privilege of receiving a full ride through various scholarships that I have applied for. Throughout my undergraduate journey, I have participated in various activities, such as being part of my school's band program, starting a food Instagram account, studying abroad, and taking on several leadership roles within my Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) chapter.

Additionally, I have had several internship experiences. Most notably, I have been a Software Engineer intern at Microsoft and at Dell Technologies. I am passionate about my Hispanic community and strive to make a positive impact through my work and involvement. I am seeking full-time employment opportunities, so please reach out at banda.gabriel100@gmail.com.
