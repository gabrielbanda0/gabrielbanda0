## Hi there, my name is Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, where I earned my degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. Iâ€™ll be joining Microsoft full-time as a Software Engineer in August 2025.

During my undergrad, I interned at Microsoft and Dell Technologies, studied abroad, marched in the UT band, and held multiple leadership roles in my SHPE chapter. I was honored to receive the Undergraduate Student Leadership Award in Engineering, a distinction recognizing leadership across the entire Cockrell School of Engineering student body.
